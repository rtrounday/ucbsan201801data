## Report Questions

What are the three conclusions we can make about the Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?

1. Projects with a goal of less than $5000 had the greatest percentage of a project success.
2. Theatre, Music and Film and Video were the project categories that had the greatest project success.
3.  Publishing and games had the greatest percentage of project failure
4. Early Spring and Summer were the best times of year for funding

What are some of the limitations of this dataset?

1. Data analyzed is limited to 4000 projects of over 300,000 projects launched on KickStarter and may not be fully representative of the projects launched on Kickstarter
2. It is unclear how the projects were selected to be part of the study whether they may have been some demographic bias.

What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
1. Project Status by Country
2. Parent and Subcategory by Country
3. Average donation by Country
