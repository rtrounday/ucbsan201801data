Unit 2 | Homework Assignment - Multiple Stock Data

Description

Created VBA script to parse 3 worksheets of stock data workbook from 2014 - 2016.  For each sheet, it captures the ticker, the total change in price, the percent change and the total volume traded for the year.  In addition, it conditionally formats the total change in price for the year.

I also committed images of the result for each year of the worksheet.
