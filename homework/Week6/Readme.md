## Description

In this assignment, we created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities 
across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we utilized
utilizing a simple Python libraries: OpenWeatherMap API, CitiPy.  In addition, we created
scatterplot to evaluate relationships of latitude on temperature, winds, cloudiness and 
humidity

## Report Questions

What are the three conclusions we can make about Pyber riders given the provided data?

1. Temperature is consistent across the similar latitudes.  
2. Wind speed is strongest at the poles of the earth
3. Higher latitude the higher the relative humidity.
